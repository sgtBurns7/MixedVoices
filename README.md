  - Create and manage multiple projects
  - Version control with metadata tracking
  - Easy navigation between versions
- **Flow Visualization**
  - Interactive flowcharts of conversation paths
  - Success rate indicators for each step
  - Click-through analysis of specific paths
- **Recording Analysis**
  - Detailed view of individual recordings
  - Transcripts and audio playback
  - Success/failure tracking
  - Path visualization for each conversation
- **Upload Interface**

## Quick Start

### Using Python API
```python
import mixedvoices

# Create a new project
project = mixedvoices.create_project("receptionist")

# or load existing project
project = mixedvoices.load_project("receptionist")

# Create a version with metadata
version = project.create_version("v1", metadata={
    "prompt": "You are a friendly receptionist.",
    "silence_threshold": 0.1
})

# or load an existing version
version = project.load_version("v1")

# Add recording to analyze
version.add_recording("path/to/recording.wav")
```

### Using Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard:
```bash
mixedvoices
```

This will start:
- API server at http://localhost:8000
- Dashboard at http://localhost:8501
